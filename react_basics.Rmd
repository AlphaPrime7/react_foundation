## What happens when a user visits a website?

1.	A client visits a site or webpage using a browser. The browser is the HTML server client.
2.	An HTML server (hosts HTML pages or documents) returns the HTML file corresponding to the web url.
3.	The browser reads the HTML and constructs the DOM. So browsers designed by google and mozilla have a function (by now I know it is a browser engine) or tool to convert HTML pages into DOMs.
